This Repo is and all related data to the Research Journal: Sea Level Prediction Using Machine Learning: A Novel Approach Combining Atmospheric and Oceanic Dynamics

**Purpose:**
1: Investigate the causes of Global Mean Sea Level (GMSL) rise due to climate change, including glacier melting and seawater expansion.
2: Highlight the challenges GMSL rise poses to urban planners, environmentalists, and disaster risk managers.
3: Propose a novel machine-learning framework for accurate GMSL rise prediction using advanced models (LSTM, Bi-LSTM, RNN, CNN-Iso).
4: Improve prediction reliability through rigorous feature engineering.
5: Provide insights into sea-level dynamics for climate adaptation and risk mitigation in vulnerable coastal areas.
